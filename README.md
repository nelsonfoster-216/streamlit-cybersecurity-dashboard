## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - Plotly for interactive charts
  - Matplotlib for static visualizations
  - Folium for geographic mapping
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn for anomaly detection
- **Geolocation Services**: GeoPy for coordinate lookup

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-dashboard.git
   cd streamlit-cybersecurity-dashboard
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run cybersecurity_dashboard.py
   ```

5. Open the dashboard:
   - Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   - Network URL will be displayed in terminal

## Dependencies

The application requires the following Python libraries:
- streamlit
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- plotly
- pycountry
- folium
- streamlit-folium
- geopy

## Use Cases

- **Security Operations Centers (SOC)**: Real-time monitoring of cyber threats
- **IT Security Teams**: Analysis of security incidents and trends
- **Executive Reporting**: High-level security status visualization
- **Data Quality Teams**: Monitoring data integrity of security systems
- **Incident Response**: Quick identification and isolation of security breaches

## Data Sources

The dashboard currently runs on simulated data that mimics real-world cybersecurity incidents. It can be connected to actual data sources like:
- SIEM systems (Splunk, ELK Stack)
- Firewall logs
- IDS/IPS alerts
- User authentication systems
- Threat intelligence feeds

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time security data sources
- Machine learning-based threat prediction
- Automated incident response workflows
- Advanced user behavior analytics
- Custom alerting and notification system
